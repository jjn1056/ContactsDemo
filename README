This is an example application I'm using for a series of blogs and also
to have a good boilerplate starter for new applications.

You can play with the application by running

    make up

on a machine that has docker installed and running.   The Web application
will run on port 5000 and you can see the email UI on port 1080.

Check 'make help' for a summary of all the commands to manage the
containers and application but I use 'make up' and 'make stop' a lot
to start and stop the containers and then 'make app-restart' which will
apply any changes to the cpanfile and sqitch migrations and then HUP
the server.
